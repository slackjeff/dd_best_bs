# dd Best bs

`dd_best_bs` is a block performance testing script with `dd`.

`dd_best_bs` measures disk write performance with different block sizes using the `dd` command. It allows you to identify the block size that provides **the best transfer rate** and highlights the most efficient result.

## ðŸ“Œ How does it work?

1. Tests multiple block sizes from **512B to 64MB**.
2. Uses the `dd` command to generate temporary files and measure write speed.
3. Optionally, **clears the kernel cache** if run as `sudo`, ensuring more accurate results.
4. Displays a table with the results of each test.
5. At the end, **highlights the block with the highest transfer rate**.


## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- **Linux** or macOS system (compatible with `dd`).
- Access to a terminal.
- (Optional) **Root permissions** to clear the kernel cache.

## ðŸ”§ How to use?

**Download or copy the script:**

```shell
wget https://github.com/slackjeff/dd_best_bs/blob/main/dd_best_bs.sh
chmod +x dd_best_bs.sh
sudo ./dd_best_bs.sh
```
